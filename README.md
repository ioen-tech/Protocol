# IOEN Protocol

## Terms:
- NanoGrid: behind the meter solar, battery and load with a list of neighbours to trade energy with
- EcoGrid: A community of NanoGrids such as a football club where NanoGrids are connected via Supply Agreements.
- Neighbourhood Battery: [In front of the meter neighbourhood storage](!https://www.energy.vic.gov.au/batteries-and-energy-storage/neighbourhood-battery-initiative)
- Value Flows - A vocabulary for the distributed economic networks of the next economy, https://www.valueflo.ws 


## What is IOEN
- Neighbour 2 Neighbour (N2N) instant local energy trading 
- IOEN Fuel is the energy backed mutual credit currency used by neighbours to buy and sell energy creating IOEN Value Flows
- IOEN Value Flows can be used as the business case for funding of new NanoGrid installations
- IOEN Value Flows also demonstrate how neighbourhood generated power increases neighbourhood prosperity
- Energy Independence from fossil fuel power is achieved when there is sufficient neighbourhood generated and stored power.


## IOEN World:
- First Person, Third Person, Electric Vehicle or Aerial 3D virtual world generated from Open Street Map data anywhere in the world into CityGen3D
- Nanogrids are generated into the scene via IOEN Generator for CityGen3D.
- Large worlds can be created by creating an array of scenes.
- People can change variables on the IOEN Generator to investigate the impact of IOEN.
- People can show the path to energy independence and how IOEN improves EcoGrid prosperity.
- NanoGrids use typical load and solar generation data https://ahd.csiro.au/other-data/typical-house-energy-use/ to calculate IOEN Value Flows
- Improve accuracy of IOEN Value Flows by connecting NanoGrids to physical meters, solar gateways or past NMI data.
- Nanogrids connected to physical meter or gateway data create value flows for funding and scheduling the installation of solar & batteries.
- Negotiate N2N Supply Agreements to join the Ecogrid.

## Holo/chain:
- Holo Hosted mobile app
- Value Flows accounting via HoloREA https://github.com/h-REA/hREA 
- Acorn for accurate scheduling of Nanogrid installations.

## IOEN DNAs
- Global DNA called nanogrid records Agent Profile for settings of the nano grid, billing details.
- Global DNA called billing for storing digested transactions and payments.
- Global DNA for IOEN Fuel, allows value transfer between EcoGrids
- EcoGrid DNA for supply agreements and energy requests called energy_supply. Cloned each day.
- EcoGrid DNA called energy_transactions for logging each transaction. 

> Fraud detection uses smart meter data and logged power transactions once a day.
Default consumers to full retail price, they get cheaper power from  eco grid when they are shown to be a good  
Charge fraudulent generator max retail price for the energy they faked
