# Backyard BBQ Protocol

## John enrolls Alice at the BBQ

- John meets Alice at a backyard BBQ
- John explains how he uses this thing redgrid.energy that;
  - saves him money
  - allows him to share, trade and keep energy $ within his community
  - allows him to provide extra dollars to his local footy club which has massive solar that's not used in weekdays so is essentially his retailer selling him excess energy.
 
- John shows alice the app on his phone which has:
  - a visual of what his costs are now vs what his costs where with only his retailer
  - a visual of the local friends and connections he is trading with
  - a visual that shows how much the footy club has accrued
  - a visual that shows the IOEN crypto that John has acrued
 - Alice is interested and John mentions that all that is required is a small box (nanogrid) device which is free and easy to install.
 - John mentions he's more than happy to help Alice get setup and take her through the install and actually by doing so John says he will earn a reward of this new clean energy currency called IOEN.
 - they agree to catchup tomorrow so John can do the install.

## The next day

- John drops by the Footy club and picks up a nanogrid and then heads to alices place. He scans a QR code on that device through his app
- John meets Alice and brings up the QR code on his phone and Alice scans it.
- Alice enrolls with her details
- John helps her with getting her smart meter and solar enrolled


## Alice begins saving money

- Alice is setup and trading with others in Johns social group.
- The footy club earns tx revenue from Alices usage (as the supplier of the nanogrid)
- John earns Tx revenue from Alices usage (from qr scanning the nanogrid)
- Alice earns more from here solar and spends less on energy thanks to redgrid.energy

## Alice goes to another BBQ and enrolls another person!




- Phil meets Gary at a backyard BBQ
- Gary is the coach for the Donald Football Club
- Phil is president of a tennis club that is running IOEN
- Phil tlls Gary that the footy club could earn money by running this thing IOEN and become an energy supplier to members
- Phil shows Gary ioen.world for the tennis club on his mobile phone
- Gary scans a QR Code from Phil's phone and creates his profile on Holo Hosted app https://ioen.world: [avatar, handle]
- Phil gets some IOEN for making the referral
- The next day Gary talks to the club and gets permission to use club member details in IOEN World
- Gary asks Phil to help get him setup (or requests help from an IOEN developer or Redgrid to get setup)
- Phil asks Gary to share his screen and teaches him how to update OSM with club member addresses
- Phil asks Gary to navigate to https://ioen.world and create a new IOEN World
- Gary uses the club member addresses & lat/long, colours, flag etc [more args] to create a new CityGen 3D model of the OSM data with IOEN NanoGrids for club members, Donald Football Club EcoGrid.
- Gary clicks the Donald Football Club Flag https://ioen.world/donald-football-club
- Which opens the Holo Hosted WebGl build of the Town of Donald - Donald Football Club EcoGrid
- Phil says to Gary "You can change a bunch of things like the list of members and the amount of solar/storage in the Eco Grid if you want to. Pretty fun actually, but first let's run it connected to the IOEN Protocol and check out the simulator stats for the club and a few of it's members", looks a bit like [dashboard](https://demos.themeselection.com/materio-vuetify-vuejs-admin-template/demo-3/dashboards/analytics) 
- Gary's keen as so a few days later Phil is at Gary's house teaching him how to do a physical install of a NanoGrid.
- When Gary shows the club leadership the graph of todays solar vs coal energy and the path to get to complete energy independence they agree to promote the Donald Football Club EcoGrid to the rest of the club through official channels.
- Gary then does the physical install of the Donald Football Club NanoGrid teaching the process to Claire & Marie who between them went on to sign up most of the club.
- The club decided to include funding and scheduling the installation of solar & batteries in the value flows of the EcoGrid to improve the EcoGrid and get to complete energy independence.
- Gary's got some capital for investing and sets up Rain Protocol Tokens to fund 20 installs each with their own arrangements for how energy is paid for.
- Gary has a BBQ!
- Luke from Esoteric is at the BBQ ....
