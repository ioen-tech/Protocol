# Backyard BBQ Protocol

- Phil meets Gary at a backyard BBQ
- Gary is the coach for the Donald Football Club
- Phil & Gary talk about IOEN for Football Clubs
- Gary scans Phil's QR Code and creates his profile on Holo Hosted app https://ioen.world: [avatar, handle]
- The next day Gary talks to the club and gets permission to use club member details in IOEN World
- Phil asks Gary to share his screen and teaches him how to update OSM with club member addresses
- Phil asks Gary to navigate to https://ioen.world and create a new IOEN World
- Gary uses the club member addresses & lat/long, colours, flag etc [more args] to create a new CityGen 3D model of the OSM data with IOEN NanoGrids for club members, Donald Football Club EcoGrid.
- Gary clicks the Donald Football Club Flag https://ioen.world/donald-football-club
- Which opens the Holo Hosted WebGl build of the Town of Donald - Donald Football Club EcoGrid
- Phil says to Gary "You can change a bunch of things like the list of members and the amount of solar/storage in the Eco Grid if you want to. Pretty fun actually, but first let's run it connected to the IOEN Protocol and check out the simulator stats for the club and a few of it's members", looks a bit like [dashboard](https://demos.themeselection.com/materio-vuetify-vuejs-admin-template/demo-3/dashboards/analytics) 
- Gary's keen as so a few days later Phil is at Gary's house teaching him how to do a physical install of a NanoGrid.
- When Gary shows the club leadership a few different models he built and how he can now show simulator data or real time data they agree to promote the Donald Football Club EcoGrid to the rest of the club through official channels.
- Gary then does the physical install of the Donald Football Club NanoGrid teaching the process to Claire & Marie who between them went on to sign up most of the club.
- Gary has a BBQ!
