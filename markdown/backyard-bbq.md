# Backyard BBQ Protocol

- Phil meets Gary at a backyard BBQ
- Gary is the coach for the Donald Football Club
- Phil is president of a tennis club that is running IOEN
- Phil tlls Gary that the footy club could earn money by running this thing IOEN and become an energy supplier to members
- Phil shows Gary ioen.world for the tennis club on his mobile phone
- Gary scans a QR Code from Phil's phone and creates his profile on Holo Hosted app https://ioen.world: [avatar, handle]
- Phil gets some IOEN for making the referral
- The next day Gary talks to the club and gets permission to use club member details in IOEN World
- Gary asks Phil to help get him setup (or requests help from an IOEN developer or Redgrid to get setup)
- Phil asks Gary to share his screen and teaches him how to update OSM with club member addresses
- Phil asks Gary to navigate to https://ioen.world and create a new IOEN World
- Gary uses the club member addresses & lat/long, colours, flag etc [more args] to create a new CityGen 3D model of the OSM data with IOEN NanoGrids for club members, Donald Football Club EcoGrid.
- Gary clicks the Donald Football Club Flag https://ioen.world/donald-football-club
- Which opens the Holo Hosted WebGl build of the Town of Donald - Donald Football Club EcoGrid
- Phil says to Gary "You can change a bunch of things like the list of members and the amount of solar/storage in the Eco Grid if you want to. Pretty fun actually, but first let's run it connected to the IOEN Protocol and check out the simulator stats for the club and a few of it's members", looks a bit like [dashboard](https://demos.themeselection.com/materio-vuetify-vuejs-admin-template/demo-3/dashboards/analytics) 
- Gary's keen as so a few days later Phil is at Gary's house teaching him how to do a physical install of a NanoGrid.
- When Gary shows the club leadership a few different models he built and how he can now show simulator data or real time data they agree to promote the Donald Football Club EcoGrid to the rest of the club through official channels.
- Gary then does the physical install of the Donald Football Club NanoGrid teaching the process to Claire & Marie who between them went on to sign up most of the club.
- Gary shares at the club meeting the IOEN explainer video and a QR screen for members to download and setup on the IOEN Donald FC Powershare mobile app.
- Gary shares how much money will be earned for the club and how much money each person will (possibly) save by getting involved and how its heaps better than a normal energy retailer because value will stay local with this setup.
- explainer video also shows members how any of them can become an energy supplier and sell energy to the community if they have a battery or solar system
- Gary has a BBQ!


# Notes
for step 18 is it necessary to have HW or could Gary just enter his PV and Battery credential for the club into a form?
be better to have physical like a modem from an ISP but its not really essential.

UIs for the setup seem to be:
- mobile app for Phil (and later for Gary and members
- web interface to IOEN world for setting up and managing projects (donald FC project).
