# Digesting Eco grid Transactions
Each time a nanogrid purchases energy from a neighbour a transaction entry is created in the Energy DNA. A nanogrid that doesnt produce any energy could create approximately 1000 transactions a day, given there could be 1000s of nanogrids in a DHT it is necessary to digest those transactions into the billing DNA on a regular basis. For now digesting will be done daily and triggered to run at 00:00:00.
The Energy DNA is installed when creating a new NanoGrid. Today's and the next day's Energy DNAs are then cloned from the running hApp with a network seed of the date in this format EcoGridName:YYYYMMDD. Each days transactions for each EcoGrid (eg Donald Football Club) are then recorded in separate DHTs which can then be archived, restored or deleted to optimise the IOEN Protocol.
> Clonable DNAs in hApps, is the ability to spawn a new DNA hash from a template DNA packaged in a hApp at any point AFTER installation.

      ioenFuelCellId,
      billingCellId,

      tomorrowsTransactionsCellId
    }
```
At midnight update protocolAppInfo 
```
transactionsCellId = tomorrowsTransactionsCellId
tomorrowsTransactionsCellId = 
```
 and trigger digest of the days transactions into Billing DHT.
