How many times have you heard, "The only person who can change you is you and the only person who you can change is yourself"? You can change yourself if so inclined because you have sovereignty over your body. But you can't force  others to change because they have their own sovereignty and can decide for themselves. 

Using your Sovereignty you can become an Agent of Prosperity in any and all of your networks. The IOEN Protocol is one way to bring prosperity to other sovereign entities such as people, animals and even trees. It is a Neighbour 2 Neighbour Agent Centric energy trading system built on Holochain allowing you to maintain your sovereignty [^1].  

The IOEN Protocol enables community groups, such as the local football club, to buy and sell energy to their members as well as members trading with each other. Most of the money that members previously paid to a power company is now circulated in the football club network of members because most if not all of the energy load is generated by football club members. This increases the prosperity of the football club and enables members to become Agents of Prosperity in their other networks.
