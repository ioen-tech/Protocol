- Supply Agreement: Each supplier has their own energy_supply DHT with the list of Supply Agreements. Each consumer is also part of this DHT.
- Supply Block: This is the amount of energy in Watts a Supplier has available for EcoGrid Transactions in the current interval. The entry is linked to Path YYYY.MM.DD.HH.INTERVAL
- Energy Request: Consumer remote_calls Suppliers in their Supply Agreements with amount of energy required.

- EcoGrid Transaction: Record of sale of energy between neighbours.
